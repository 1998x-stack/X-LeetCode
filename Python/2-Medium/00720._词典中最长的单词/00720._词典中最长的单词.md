## 1. 问题的内容
**1.1 题目描述**：
The problem, "[720. Longest Word in Dictionary](https://leetcode.cn/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary)," asks us to find the longest word in a list of strings such that every prefix of the word is also in the list. If multiple such words of the maximum length exist, we should return the lexicographically smallest one. 

**1.2 示例**：
Given `words = ["w","wo","wor","worl", "world"]`, the longest word that satisfies the condition is "world" since every prefix ("w", "wo", "wor", "worl") is also present in the list.

**1.3 提示**:
- Each word's prefixes must also be in the list.
- If multiple valid longest words exist, return the lexicographically smallest one.

## 2. 边界情况和约束
**Constraints:**
- The list can contain a large number of strings, indicating the need for an efficient algorithm.
- Strings can vary in length, and the list can include very short and very long strings.

**Boundary Cases:**
- An empty list should return an empty string.
- Lists where no word has all its prefixes in the list should return an empty string.
- Lists with one-letter words that all appear in the list should correctly return the single letter if no longer word qualifies.

## 3. 算法和策略
**Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Trie Construction**: Build a trie where each node represents a letter of a word inserted.
2. **Check Validity**: During insertion, mark nodes (letters) that represent valid words.
3. **Search Longest Word**: Traverse the trie to find the deepest node (letter) that forms a valid word. Use depth-first search to ensure the longest word is found, and track lexicographical order by alphabetically exploring child nodes.
